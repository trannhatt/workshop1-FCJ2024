#### Create and Configure Route Tables

In this section, we will create route tables for our VPC to manage the routing of network traffic. Specifically, we will set up a Public Route Table to enable communication with the Internet through an Internet Gateway, and a Main Route Table to handle internal communication within the VPC.
